# Description about the projects

The **1st project** involved extracting data from the csv file and cleaning the data. It also involved removing unnessecary features and selective choosing of the data according to our
needs. Then finally all the relevant data was plotted in many different ways for easier analysis.

The **2nd project** involved training on the data to create a model. Many different algorithms such as **regression,Decision trees,random forest** etc were used. The
hyperparameters were tuned for the best model for the different algorithms. The error plots were plotted to determine the best model.

The **3rd project** involved implementing different clustering algorithms such as Kmeans, DBSCAN, PCA etc. Again plots were plotted for optimal hyperparameter values such as 
elbow plot for different k's for K-Means Clustering.
